ðŸŒ‹ Class Explosion Problem

The Class Explosion Problem occurs when you rely heavily on inheritance to add or combine multiple features, leading to an excessive number of subclasses.
As the number of combinations increases, the number of classes grows exponentially, making the system difficult to maintain and extend.

âœ… Why Does the Class Explosion Problem Occur?

When you use inheritance to add functionalities, you create subclasses for every possible combination of features.
As more features are added, you need to create new subclasses for each combination, leading to code duplication and an unmanageable number of classes.

ðŸš€ Example: Class Explosion with Coffee Variants

Imagine you're building a coffee ordering system.
You want to support the following combinations of coffee:

Base types: Coffee, Espresso, Latte.
Add-ons: Milk, Sugar, Caramel, and Whipped Cream.

ðŸ”¥ Using Inheritance â†’ Class Explosion
If you use inheritance to represent every combination of coffee and add-ons, you end up with:

Base Classes:
- Coffee
- Espresso
- Latte

Combinations:
- CoffeeWithMilk
- CoffeeWithSugar
- CoffeeWithMilkAndSugar
- CoffeeWithCaramel
- EspressoWithMilk
- EspressoWithSugar
- EspressoWithCaramel
- LatteWithMilk
- LatteWithSugar
- LatteWithCaramel
- LatteWithMilkAndSugar
- EspressoWithMilkAndCaramel
- ... (many more)

ðŸ’¡ Why Is This a Problem?
Code Duplication: Each subclass duplicates code from its parent class, making changes tedious.
Unmanageable Complexity: The codebase becomes hard to navigate and maintain.
Difficult to Extend: Adding a new feature requires creating multiple new subclasses.
Tight Coupling: It creates a strong dependency between classes, making the system less flexible.

ðŸš¦ Key Takeaway

ðŸš« Inheritance-based approach:
Leads to class explosion.
Hard to maintain and extend.
Requires multiple subclasses for every combination.

âœ… Decorator-based approach:
Flexible and dynamic behavior addition at runtime.
Easy to extend with new decorators.
No class explosion â†’ Uses composition instead of inheritance.
